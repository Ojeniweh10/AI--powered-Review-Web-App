# AI--powered-Review-Web-App
this is a review web application that uses ai to check reviews about products that people post online to figure out if they have negative or positive sentiment

note: i plan to dockerize this entire application so you can easily run it on your own docker enviroment if you wish to without having to pull the source code files and start figuring out how to configure them, of course the source code files will also be here for people to download make improvements or amendments and push back, since the project is open source
